# blockcontent

**Structured Content Format for AI Agents, Interfaces, and Beyond**

`blockcontent` is a schema-driven format designed for expressing structured, modular content blocks — suitable for AI assistant outputs, dynamic UI rendering, industrial workflows, or knowledge representation.

## ✨ Motivation

Modern AI applications, interfaces, and automation systems often need to generate or interpret structured content — not just plain text. Whether it's a chart, a configuration form, a summarized section, or a warning, we need a shared way to express these **blocks of meaning**.

`blockcontent` provides:

- 🧱 **Composable Blocks** – like `text`, `chart`, `alert`, etc.
- 🌐 **Multi-language SDKs** – auto-generated from a shared schema
- 🤖 **Agent-Friendly Output** – designed for LangChain, ReAct, RAG, etc.
- 🔧 **Spec-Driven Design** – define once, generate everywhere
